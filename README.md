# Yuma_Energy_Assessment

Here’s how we can approach this task based on the requirements provided in the document:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
**Steps to Follow:**
   - **Loading Data**: Start by loading the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - **Initial Inspection**: Check the data types, look for missing values, identify unique values, and get a general sense of the data distribution.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Depending on the nature of missing data, either fill them with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median) or drop them.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove any duplicates, standardize formats (e.g., dates, text capitalization), and correct any obvious errors.
   - **Thought Process**: The first step is to understand the structure of the data, its quality, and any obvious issues that could impact analysis. Preprocessing ensures the data is clean and ready for meaningful analysis.

### **2. Data Aggregation and Grouping**
**Fields to Aggregate**:
   - **Numerical Columns**: 
     - Sum, mean, median, and count can be used to aggregate sales data.
     - Total sales per category, average sales per transaction, and total transactions per date.
   - **Categorical Columns**: 
     - Group by categories like product type, region, or sales channel to find aggregated metrics like total sales or average sales per category.
   - **Aggregation Logic**: Summing sales figures makes sense for understanding overall revenue, while mean and median provide insights into average performance. Counting entries can help track transaction volume.

### **3. Data Validation**
**Validation Process**:
   - **Cross-Verification**: Compare aggregated data against raw data summaries to ensure consistency.
   - **Edge Cases**: Consider cases with zero sales, extremely high sales, or unusual dates to ensure they’re handled correctly.
   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data is lost during preprocessing, and all transformations are reversible if needed.

### **4. Data Visualization**
**Possible Projections**:
   - **Time Series Analysis**: Line chart for sales over time.
   - **Category Comparisons**: Bar chart comparing sales across different categories.
   - **Geographical Sales**: Heatmap if geographical data is available.

**Linear Projections**: 
   - Scatter plots with trend lines can help determine if data follows a linear pattern.

**Graphical Representations**:
   - **Line Chart**: For time-series data.
   - **Bar Chart**: For category comparisons.

### **5. Code Implementation**
I’ll provide Python code to preprocess the data, perform aggregation, validate the results, and create visualizations. Additionally, I’ll show how to insert the data into a SQL database and perform similar operations using SQL.

Let me start with the preprocessing and then we can move step by step. I’ll use Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn) for this. Ready to proceed?
